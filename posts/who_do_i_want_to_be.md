I want my life defined by courage. This means expecting the best possible outcome, not the average case. This is faith. I don't want to live in fear, which is expecting the worst-case outcome.

I want to be content with nothing yet desire everything.

I want to be [humble](/true_humility), yet confident.

I want to be on fire for God. This happens by experiencing God, and re-experiencing him time after time.

I want to be surrounded by people smarter, wiser, and more mature than me. People I respect and look up to.

I want to care how people feel, and live with compassion. I don't want to care how people think.

I want to dream big. Even if my dreams were never to come true, I want to dream.

I want to hear God's voice clearly and consistently. I want to feel his heart.

I want to live a blameless life, fearing God and turning away from evil.

I want to live primarily by "do"s and secondly by "don't"s. I want my eyes to be fixed on Jesus, not the world.

I want to [love God](/character) and [love people](/isaiah_58).

I want to pray confidently and quietly. Peaceful and selfless prayers, that if answered, would draw me closer to God, not pull me away. I want my prayers to reflect his heart. I want to be someone God trusts, someone whom the devil is terrified of what I'll ask.

My primary driver at every moment should be to make room to experience God.
