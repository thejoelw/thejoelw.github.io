I spent some time with a homeless man the other day. He said something I've been thinking about since: "Sometimes the silence is more dangerous than the noise".

Battles are noisy, and if you're not fighting for a cause, then what are you doing? Drifting with the wind and currents. Easy and peaceful but who knows where you'll end up.
