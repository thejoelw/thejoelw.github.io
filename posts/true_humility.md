I used to think humility was the most important quality a person could pursue. If you're humble you can "fix" any other deficient quality, because you'll listen to the people who are giving you feedback.

But I became an indecisive person. I never came to a conclusion on anything. I always left the door open to myself being wrong. I emerged with a pretty solid system of beliefs but I never committed; never spoke out.

Courage is a good thing. It takes courage to state a position, and potentially be wrong. The trick is to be confident in what you think, while still being open to being wrong.

You have a responsibility to disagree with those you love when there's a difference of opinion. Both of you have the potential to grow; to learn something new; to be sharpened. And quietly acquiescing your viewpoint robs either you or the other person an opportunity to improve.

What does humility with confidence look like? Respect. Admiration. You consider the other person as having something to offer. Something they have you don't. It's not pride that's the problem, but arrogance. Looking down on others.

For the last few years I've attempted to maintain a positive sentiment towards people. I try to treat people as I would treat their ideal version, not the version they are today. I focus on teaching that pulls me towards something good, instead of push me away from something bad. I give people ownership and responsibility, and expect the best from them. This is how God treats humanity.

You cannot love someone you think is "less than" yourself. Someone you look down on. It's impossible. Our call to love humanity implies that we "look up" to people. Even our enemies. We respect and admire the things they do well; the things they can teach us. And we have the courage to call them out on their sin and deficiencies.

This is true humility.
