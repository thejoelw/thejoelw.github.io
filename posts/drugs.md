For a long time I've held a neutral view on light recreational drugs. I tried to base this on my interpretation of the Bible. My interpretation is that most guidance related to drugs refers to being sober-minded, which in my experience, is a pretty clear boundary that can be kept within.

However there's another aspect I hadn't considered. In my experience, I don't think it's possible to explain my convictions and be loving at the same time when interacting with those who've been hurt by drugs, or work with those who have.

I want my life to be marked by love. Defined by love. And love is entering into the suffering of others, the heartache, voluntarily. I want compassion to be my compass, not correctness. A little sober-minded high now and then is not worth the distance it creates between me and those scarred by the suffering caused by a drug.

I think this is the way I'm going to live my life. I suppose a similar argument can be made for alcohol.
