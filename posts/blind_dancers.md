There's a place where darkness hangs,  
A cloud of misery and of pain.  
And though it never comes to mind,  
A swarm of demons flies inside.  

But I'm drawn there every day,  
Paper chains prevent escape.  
Again I'll fold my hands and pray,  
But no one's there to hear my fate.  

I beg you let me feel your heart,  
And cry as I am torn apart.  
Blind men dancing to the grave,  
Never to rise unless you save.  

I found a place where beauty moves,  
Knowledge bounds in heads of fools.  
But no dark cloud hangs over here,  
The wise man's prayer the demons fear.  

Some blessed few can see their path,  
The rest, doomed men learning to dance.  
The door, O Lord, is open wide,  
Waiting for you to step inside.  

I beg you let me feel your heart,  
And cry as I am torn apart.  
Blind men dancing to the grave,  
Never to rise unless you save.  

There's a place where wisdom dwells,  
A final stronghold from the swells.  
It's there I go to feel your rest,  
Lose what's good then find it's best.  

In the end, I'll stand beside,  
Souls tread past who never died.  
Some I knew and yet ignored,  
Watching as they plead "Lord, Lord".  

I beg you let me feel your heart,  
And cry as I am torn apart.  
Blind men dancing to the grave,  
Never to rise unless you save.
