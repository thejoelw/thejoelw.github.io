These are the most important aspects of your character: your love/attitude towards:
1. God
2. Other people
3. Yourself

Love is hard to define. But one of the foundations for love is a positive attitude. Admiration. Respect. Do you look up or down at the object of love? You can't love something you despise.

In [true humility](/true_humility) I described how my attitude towards other people has changed over time. What I pursue now is something like "respect", "admiration", or "looking up to". It's an expectation of the best in other people.

This generalizes to God. The way you see God is perhaps the most important thing about you. The way you see God defines how you seek him. How you expect to experience him. Your faith. It's life-changing. There's no prayer more life-changing than asking God to show you himself.

Seeing God as someone worthy of respect is, I believe, what the Bible refers to as the "fear of God". Not only a stylish fashion brand, it's essential to living a beautiful life. The primary danger of disregarding God's words, sin, is not what it'll do to you, but what it'll do to your relationship with God.

Life is too short to spend time looking down on people. We are called to love; to descend to them and lift them up. There is no "stupid" person, no "idiot". Ideas and thoughts can be stupid, but not people. Someday, Jesus will judge every person, but until that day our job is to love.

It also generalizes to yourself. Too many people look down on themselves, or feel shame or regret towards their being. We are called to love what God loves, and God loves you. God sees something beautiful in you. He created you perfectly, the body, the personality, the history, to match the being he wanted to meet someday.

What kind of plans do you think God has for you? I guarantee you're thinking too small. God created you to change the world. To change eternity. You are not a victim of your environment, you are the torch created to flood the darkness with light and spark a wildfire.
