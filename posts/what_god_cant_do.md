You gave up your son for me,  
I raise up my hands.  
You laid down your life for me,  
I fall to the ground.  

What could I do that could ever repay?  
Go to church every week, pray every day?  
Which of these things will make you say "well done"?  
"Child come rest, your race has been won".  

What gift can I bring,  
Oh Lord how can I bless?  
A god who owns everything,  
Has full root access?  

What can I give to you,  
That you cannot take?  
What can I bring to you,  
That you didn't make?  

You can't make me love you,  
So that's what I'll do.  
I'll make this heart sing,  
Filled with praises to you.
