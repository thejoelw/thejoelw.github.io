To present or to conceal?

At work my status reports are one or two sentences; I give a succinct overview without embellishment. In relationships I tend to wait for people to discover me. I've always took pride in this "humility", but there's nothing quite like the ego boost after mentioning something impressive offhandedly when it comes up naturally.

Apple presents. Their store is immaculate, bright, and inviting. Clean, pure, and focused. The box is crisp, beautiful, and satisfying. It entices you, fills you with anticipation of what's to come. Indeed, Apple presents an entire experience, and generally they deliver.

Does God present? I'm not sure, but I know that he conceals (Proverbs 25:2). God wants us to seek him; he's hard to find. Matthew 13 is almost entirely dedicated to explaining this, and ends by noting the people who were too familiar with Jesus weren't able to accept him.

Why? Because he wants the finding to be meaningful. He doesn't want lots of lukewarm followers, he wants a few firey ones.

He also seems to like putting beautiful things into ugly packages. He puts the Holy Spirit into us. He repeatedly calls nobodies like Gideon, Jacob, David, and Matthew. He shows up in the most hopeless of circumstances to make his power shine even brigher.

But he also reveals himself. He promises to be found by those who seek him (Proverbs 8:17), and even sometimes to those who aren't (Saul).

What's the difference? In each of these examples, the presentation is tailored for eternity. The end result. God could immediately reveal himself unquestionably to humanity, but he doesn't because he wants eternity to be filled with children who've chosen him.

I suppose it's not all about me. Presentation shouldn't be a balance between humility and pride, but a balance between giving and withholding. Is what I have to give valuable and useful? Then give it. Otherwise, retain it. It's not about me, it's about the person I'm interacting with. How can my qualities best impact/help them?

I have a responsibility to the people around me (Proverbs 3:27). My gifts aren't my own, they were given to me by God to help others. I meed to learn better how to disassociate them from my ego, freeing them to be shared humbly.
