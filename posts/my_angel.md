Do you remember, love, my angel?
Prancing upon the clouds,
Beneath our feet, the stars, alighting,
Dancing our melody.

I fell for your heart, my love, my angel,
Our vows diamonds, set in song,
Your chorus a flame, a feast, yet pending,
Perfected in tragedy.

I tore you apart, my love, my angel,
Erased every trace of me,
Your flame I watch flicker, slowly, waiting,
For love to run rescuing.

Do you perceive, my love, my angel,
Our melody through the trees,
Climb to the mountain's summit,
I'll evoke our eternity.
