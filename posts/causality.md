The fundamental laws of the universe are [equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_law#Exact_laws). They deal with two things being equal. There is no "causality" involved.

Causality makes sense only [within time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_%28physics%29). As we experience the passage of time in a particular direction, we experience causality.

I wonder if there's any interesting observations we can make about God, who exists outside of time.
