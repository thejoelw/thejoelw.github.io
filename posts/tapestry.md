I've walked for miles, chasing you,  
Down long and winding roads.  
Fleeting glimpses, wind and smoke,  
Whisper you are close.  

Certainty is like a road,  
It takes one to an end.  
But love must lead where streetlights stop,  
Until firm's found again.  

As a photon lost in space,  
Who dare not change its course.  
So I tread on aimlessly,  
Through galaxies diverse.  

Amongst the clouds, with earth below,  
Surely you are near.  
But like the past eternity,  
My thoughts are all I hear.  

The greatest terror of mankind,  
Is sitting with one's self.  
To realize he cannot contend,  
With what's lurking in the depths.  

But deeper still, are memories,  
Of you within my dreams.  
And as life fades and love remains,  
You are here with me.  

There's no meaning, there's no rhyme,  
Til the silver cord is torn.  
When one can see, in tapestry,  
The beauty they've adorned.
