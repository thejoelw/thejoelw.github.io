It is the lonely who are close to God
Not because, as so many simply assume, they have no one else,
But because the loneliness of God can be known only by these.

It is the heartbroken who are close to God
Not because, as so many simply assume, they have only him to which to turn,
But because their God's heart has been broken too.
